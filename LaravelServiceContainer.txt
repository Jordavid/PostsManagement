Service container and Auto-Resolution
- Route Model Binding RMB -> get access to a class and all its components.
Laravel uses 2 concepts to accomplish the RMB
- Auto Resolver -> Assume that we need an instance of a Specific Class and check in 
the Service Container if that class exist, if yes, it gives you an instance of the class
- Service Container -> Can be considered as a Big Block of Key-Value Pair

To register a new Block in the container:

app()->bind('example', function(){
	
	return new ClassName;
});

And Call it in the Controller or Anywhere:

dd(app('example'));
